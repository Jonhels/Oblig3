            <h2>Sustainable goal 13</h2>
            <p>
                Sustainable goal 13 aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impact on our planet.
                The planet is currently changing because of humans and our industrial demands and usage of the resources
                that we currently have available to us. This can be deforestation, burning fossil fuels and
                overproduction of consumer goods.

            <h2>What we aim for</h2>
            <p>
                We aim to work for a better world, we are focused on how humans change the environment through littering
                the planet and what we can do to change this through recycling. Recycling is really beneficial to us
                because it gives us an opportunity to do a little better for our planet. Our home.
            </p>
            <p>
                With recycling we reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and incinerators, conserves natural
                resources such as timer, water and minerals. And all this will help us to prevent pollution and save the
                environment that we live in.

            <h2>Engage yourself!</h2>
            <p>
                It’s important that everyone follows up on the climate situation that we are living in and fighting.
                Make sure to learn how to recycle, it will only save the planet and create a better future for everyone
                around us. People that are living here today and people of the future needs a clean planet to live on,
                how can we call this a home when we don’t even want to take care of it?
            </p>
            <p>
                Many dreams about moving to a
                new planet like mars, but we think that this is just a bad idea. How can we focus on creating two
                livable planets when we can’t even take care of our original home? Recycle will save the planet and
                together we can work to become better humans for the human next to us.
