            <h2>Game information, how to play</h2>
            <p>
                The game has been created with the environment in our minds, here we are focused on how we can teach
                lower secondary education students with the age of 13-16, class 8-10 about recycling. This game is
                created as a group activity for smaller groups (3-5 people).
            </p>
            <p>
                The game consists of a circle where we have to toss a dice, the dice will give us a number between 1-6.
                Move the playing piece to the number you got and let the next person take his/her turn.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the player gets to the next 1 on the playing board they have arrived at the first trashcan. The
                trashcan is where you toss the garbage and we have two entrances to it. Number 1 is food waste and
                number 2 is residual waste. One point from each depending on the type of garbage you are throwing away.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the trashcan we have number 2, 4, 5, 6. These numbers consists of waste you have to bring and
                highest number contains the highest points. 2 points (food waste), 4 points (residual waste), 5 points
                (food waste), 6 (residual waste). You can only bring one type of trash and that is the first one you
                land on in the trash section of the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have collected garbage and lands on the wrong trashcan you will lose the same amount of points
                that the trash you have collected are worth.
            </p>
            <p>
                That is the game and the first one to reach a 100 points wins the game.
